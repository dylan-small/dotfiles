# GitHub Dark Color Theme

A GitHub inspired dark [color theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=david-j-lee.github-dark-color-theme)
for VS Code.

This color scheme is based off of the
[official theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme).
Updates have been made to try and follow the color schema used on the GitHub
website as close as possible.

Feel free to contribute on the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/david-j-lee/vscode-github-dark-theme).
